## Welcome!

Welcome to the first of the newsletters for 2023. It's been quite a while since we last put a newsletter together, so thanks for bearing with us. It's been a busy time at the 14th Canterbury over the last year. Brian, our long standing GSL, retired in 2022. Since then the teams here have been busy organising - both the existing sections and also getting ready to start a new one! 

Hopefully going forward newsletters will be collaboratively authored by many members of the team, so we should be able to get back to sending out more regualar updates. We're also going make the Newsletters digital only, so it should be really easy to access and share - you can just click the link or scan the QR code that we will send out - example below!

The newsletters will all be published to our web site - [www.14thcanterbury.org](https://www.14thcanterbury.org/newsletter/2023/05/05/newsletter.html) - and hopefully overtime we will start adding more functionlity here, including email updates.

We're just about ready to lauch our Squirrels section, for 4-6 year olds! You can read more about that later in the newsletter.  

We've also been busy fundraising for our 3 scouts who will be attending the World Scout Jamboree (WSJ), this year in South Korea! 

Running a Scout Group takes a lot of people working together, from "front-line" leader roles through to administrative roles. At the moment a lot of the team members wear many hats and have overlapping roles. We'd love to expand the number of people in all of our teams - you can find out more about some of the many roles we would love to fill. We're also open to suggestions! If you feel you have either expertise or a passion for a skill set that could benifit the Group, then please let us know!
